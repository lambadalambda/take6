# 6 Nimmt! (Take 6) - Game Rules

## Overview
6 Nimmt! is a card game for 2-10 players designed by Wolfgang Kramer. The goal is to avoid collecting penalty points (represented by bull heads on the cards). The player with the fewest penalty points wins.

## Components
- 104 cards numbered 1-104
- Each card displays bull heads representing penalty points:
  - Cards ending in 5 (except 55): 2 bull heads
  - Cards ending in 0: 3 bull heads
  - Cards ending in 11 (11, 22, 33, etc.): 5 bull heads
  - Card 55: 7 bull heads
  - All other cards: 1 bull head

## Setup
1. Shuffle all 104 cards
2. Deal 10 cards to each player
3. Place 4 cards face-up in a vertical column on the table - these are the starting cards for 4 rows
4. Each row can hold a maximum of 5 cards before being collected

## Gameplay

### Each Round
1. **Card Selection**: All players simultaneously choose one card from their hand and place it face-down
2. **Reveal**: Once everyone has chosen, all cards are revealed simultaneously
3. **Placement**: Starting with the lowest numbered card and proceeding in ascending order, each player places their card according to the placement rules

### Card Placement Rules
When placing your card, you must:
1. Place it at the end of a row where the last card is **lower** than your card
2. Choose the row where the last card is **closest** in value to your card
3. Your card becomes the new end of that row

### Special Situations

#### Taking a Row (6th Card)
- If your card would be the 6th card in a row, you must:
  - Take all 5 cards currently in that row (add them to your penalty pile)
  - Your card becomes the new starting card for that row

#### Card Too Low
- If your card is lower than the last card in ALL four rows:
  - Choose any row and take all cards in it (add them to your penalty pile)
  - Your card becomes the new starting card for that chosen row

### Example
If the rows end with: 15, 37, 49, 72
- Playing card 18 goes after 15 (closest lower value)
- Playing card 50 goes after 49 (closest lower value)
- Playing card 10 means taking a full row (too low for all rows)

## End of Round
- After 10 turns (when all hand cards are played), the round ends
- Players count the bull heads on all cards they collected
- Record scores and shuffle all cards for the next round

## Game End & Winning
- Play multiple rounds until at least one player reaches 66 or more total penalty points
- The player with the **fewest** penalty points wins

## Strategy Tips
- Try to play cards that won't be the 6th in a row
- Watch what cards have been played to predict which rows might fill up
- Sometimes it's better to take a row with few penalty points early rather than risk taking a worse row later
- Cards ending in 5, 0, and multiples of 11 are especially dangerous to collect

## Variants

### Professional Variant
- Instead of dealing 10 cards to each player, deal all cards evenly
- Players play with larger hands (varies by player count)

### Tactical Variant
- Players can choose which row to take when playing a too-low card
- Adds more strategic decision-making
